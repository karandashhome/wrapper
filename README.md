# "WrapperPythonChatGPT"

This project is a simple wrapper for working with the chatGPT model via API, which can be useful if you are unable to access the model on other devices. Please note that the installation instructions are approximate, as I do not remember every step and relied on logic. Thank you for your understanding!

## System requirements for GPT chat shell:

- Computer with Windows, macOS or Linux operating system;
- Python version 3.6 or higher installed;
- Access to OpenAI API key for authentication and use of GPT model;
